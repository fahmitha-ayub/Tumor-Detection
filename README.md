# Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies deep learning techniques to detect tumors from medical images. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed and trained to classify tumor vs. non-tumor cases, demonstrating the use of AI in medical diagnosis.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Train a CNN model to classify tumor vs. non-tumor cases.
- Apply optimization techniques to improve training performance.
- Evaluate the model with accuracy and classification metrics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Steps
1. Data loading and preparation.  
2. CNN model design with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense, and Dropout layers.  
3. Training the model with hyperparameter adjustments (epochs, batch size, learning rate).  
4. Performance evaluation using metrics and confusion matrix.
