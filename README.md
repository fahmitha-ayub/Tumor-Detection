# Tumor Detection using Random Forest

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to detect tumors using a Random Forest Classifier. The model classifies tumor vs. non-tumor cases based on input features from the dataset.

## 🔍 Tasks Completed
- Loaded and prepared dataset for classification.
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier for tumor detection.
- Evaluated the model with accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Visualized results to analyze prediction performance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Google Colab
